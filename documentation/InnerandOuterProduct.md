## Inner Product:

The inner product is a mathematical operation that takes two vectors and returns a scalar. It generalizes the concept of the dot product from Euclidean space to more abstract vector spaces.
For two vectors $\vec{{a}}$ and $\vec{{b}}$ in n-dimensional space, the inner product is defined as :
$\displaystyle\vec{{a}}.\vec{{b}}={a}_{{1}}{b}_{{1}}+{a}_{{2}}{b}_{{2}}+{a}_{{3}}{b}_{{3}}\ldots+{a}_{{n}}{b}_{{n}}$

In Einstein notation, this can be written as:
$\vec{{a}}\cdot\vec{{b}}={a}_{{i}}{b}^{i}$

This results in a scalar value that measures the degree to which the two vectors point in the same direction. the inner product serves as a foundational tool in various domains, allowing for the analysis of angles, magnitudes, projections, work done, and relationships between different physical quantities.

## Outer Product: 

The outer product can be used to represent transformations in higher-dimensional spaces. In physics, outer products are foundational in creating tensors, which are essential for describing various physical phenomena.

For two vectors a and b, the outer product  takes two vectors and forms a matrix whose elements are the products of the components of the vectors.

In Einstein notation, this can be written as:
$\vec{{a}}\times\vec{{b}}={a}^{i}{b}^{i}$

Expanded Form:
$C = a \times b = a_i b_j$
